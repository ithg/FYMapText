	}
	"** ...and as lovers they meet: different but equal in ways they couldn't tell... **"
	{

		"chi"		"** **"
	}
	"** Oh! What could you not have done with some more time? **"
	{
		"chi"		"** **"
	}
	"** Sadly, we shall never know -- for time is the only resource truly long gone! **"
	{

	{
		"chi"		"** **"
	}
	"** Down, down and sliding -- If sad, don't forget smiling... **"

	"** If I were you, I'd look up some 70's Canterbury bands to go with the Bucholics of this land... **"
	{
		"chi"		"** **"
	}
	"** But as finding keys and levers that open mouths and brains is more important, I'd diversify as well. **"
